          >Charles Bukowski was born in Germany, shortly after World War I, to a
          German mother and American soldier father. When he was two years,
          eight months old, his parents put him on a ship and brought him to the
          United States, where they settled in Los Angeles, California, near the
          father's family. Shortly after America joined World War II, Bukowski
          left Los Angeles, traveling to various cities around the country,
          spending the bulk of his time in Philadelphia and New Orleans. In 1947
          he returned to Los Angeles, where he lived for the remainder of his
          life. While "on the road," Bukowski was published for the first time
          in Story magazine. The year was</p

          story writer who only occasionally wrote poetry. But a decade later,
          in 1954, that would change after Bukowski suffered an internal
          hemorrhage and spent nine days on the cusp of death in Los Angeles
          County Hospital. After that experience, he began writing much more
          poetry and quickly became one of the most unique and influential
          voices in 20th-century American poetry. Ultimately, Bukowski is
          perhaps more well-known for his novels, such as
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_(novel)" target="_blank">Post Office</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factotum_(novel)" target="_blank">Factotum</a>,

          poetry. But even while he was working on novels he continued to write
          poetry and short stories. In fact, at the time of his death in 1994,
          Bukowski had written over 5,300 poems and stories. And those are only
          the titles that we know of. There were likely hundreds more that were
          written—and subsequently lost—in the 1940s, 50s, and 60s, before he
          began keeping copies of his work.</p

          >Bukowski lived most of his life in Los Angeles. He briefly attended
          Los Angeles City College (1939–41) and worked at menial jobs while
          writing short stories, the first of which were published in the
          mid-1940s. After a 10-year period during which he abandoned writing
          and traveled across the U.S. living the life of a destitute alcoholic
          drifter, he returned to Los Angeles and began publishing poetry in
          1955. Though he had begun his career as one of the ultimate “cult
          authors,” his work was so popular and influential that by the time of
          his death he was one of the best-known American authors and an
          established part of the 20th-century literary canon. Bukowski was such
          a prolific writer that his production outstripped his own life span;
          numerous collections of his previously unpublished poetry appeared
          posthumously, such as <em>Slouching Toward Nirvana (2005)</em> and
          <em>The People Look Like Flowers At Last (2007)</em>.</p
